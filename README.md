# MyColor.Today

mycolor.today visualizes your Internet browsing history by capturing the average pixel color of each web page you access. the result, visualized on a daily basis, presents a different idea on what browsing means to the everyday viewer.

Everday we stare at computer screens as we type out emails, write code, upload photos, and push around pixels. Billions of pages of information splashed with text and images are accessed daily, composed of pixels emanating from a screen connected to a computer connected to the Internet. Together, these pixels visually speak to the viewer of the relationship between content and code.

When seen both singularly and collectively as part of a broader history of browsing, patterns emerge that create a portrait of the activity of that Internet surfer. The day-to-day browsing captures, in color, a reflection of the surfer created of themselves. To wit, the surfer creates a digital selfie representation based on their browsing of others' selfies.
